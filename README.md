# Beginner-Facial-Recognizer
### How to run with new images: 
A face recognizer on a basic level for which you will have to upload images in the folder images under the name of the person whose images are being uploaded and then train the program by running faces_train.py after which you can run faces.py to idenitfy the face that is being presented on the webcam. 
### Potential uses:
Recognize a known face and than activate a desired a function accordingly, i.e. the camera recognmizes the person and starts recording.
### Drawbacks and future improvements:
Not using machine learning libraires makes it faster to write the code however at the same time its accuracy is iffy sometimes, and the code is limted to the images we upload ourselves. Making use of convolutional neural network will improve the range and accuracy of this recognizer.
